# Project-Defiance
For the UPCSG Game Jam 2026 by Vince Antolihao, Russell Beduya, Angelo Manlangit, CJ Retiza, and Cole Unson <br>
Project-Defiance is a 3D Platformer where the theme is defiance (path less taken in society) where you gotta complete a level fast and find shortcuts wherever you can. It is built around speed, creativity, and rebellion. Instead of following preset routes, players are encouraged to experiment, break conventions, and find unconventional shortcuts. Every level rewards curiosity and bold movement because the fastest path is rarely the obvious one.

**📖 Game Lore** <br>
In a world where society moves in lockstep under rules dictated by unseen elite powers, Katsumi refuses to conform. Tired of being told where to go and how to act, he chooses to carve his own path no matter how unconventional. While others follow the prescribed routes, you don’t. Use unexpected items, bend (and defy) the laws of physics, and explore freely to reach your goal your own way. Stray from the obvious path, outsmart the system, and discover faster, smarter solutions in a world built to keep you in line. You carve the path less taken.
